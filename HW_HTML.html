    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol class = "section2">
        <li>Add bacon and 1/2 cup of the water to a large non-stick skillet and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Allow to swimmer until water evaporates about 6-7 minutes, then reduce heat to medium-low and continue to cook until bacon is brown and crisp, about 6-8 minutes longer. </li>
        <li>Place a fine mesh strainer over a bowl then pour bacon into strainer while reserving about 1 tsp of the rendered fat in pan. Return pan to heat and saute garlic about 30 seconds, until fragrant and lightly golde.</li>
        <li>Pour into a medium mixing bowl then add 1 Tbsp rendered bacon fat (drippings in bowl set under strainer) to mixing bowl with garlic. Add eggs, edd yolk, Parmesan and pepper to garlic mixture and whisk untill well combined.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, bring 8 cups of water to a boil in a large dutch oven (no more than 8 cups, because you want a very starchy water for the sauce). Add spaghetti and salt to boiling water and cook until al dente. While pasta is boiling, set a colander in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Carefully drain al dente pasta into colander in bowl, while reserving pasta water in bowl. Measure out 1 cup hot pasta water and discard remaining water. Immediately place pasta in now empty large bowl.</li>
        <li>Slowly pour and whisk 1/2 cup pasta water into egg mixture, then slowly pour mixture over pasta while tossing to coat. Add bacon and toss to combine. Season with salt if desired.</li>
        <li>Let paste rest, tossing frequently, 2-4 minutes until sauce has thickened slightly and coats pasta. Thin with remaining 1/2 cup pasta water as needed. Serve immediately topped with additional Parmesan and parsley. </li>
